# HEAT Helper

`heat-helper` is a Python utility library designed to streamline the cleaning and preparation of student data for the [Higher Education Access Tracker (HEAT)](https://heat.ac.uk).

Preparing CSV or Excel files for HEAT often involves repetitive tasks like cleaning and formatting of names, year groups, and postcodes. This package automates those common data-cleaning tasks to ensure your imports are valid and consistent. It also provides functions to help you match students to your existing HEAT records and get their IDs to support you in reducing duplicate records uploaded to the database and with registering students to activities.

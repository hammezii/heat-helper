# Development

`heat_helper` is in daily use by the development team and is likely to be updated frequently. Contributions or ideas for new functions are welcome; please get in touch via [GitHub](https://github.com/hammezii/heat-helper). 

The design philosophy for `heat_helper` is simple: the package should be as accessible as possible for users with limited python experience, or for beginners who are getting into python for the first time. For these users, functions should be easy to call, have robust error handling (with readable, easy-to-understand error messages), and cover a wide range of useful repetitive tasks they are likely to carry out with their data.

Dependencies should also be limited to common data science libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `pydantic`.
